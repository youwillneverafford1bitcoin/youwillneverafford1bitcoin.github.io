      <p>i studied CS a while back til 2018, was lucky enough to <a href="https://engineerseekingfire.com/how-to-start-and-grow-your-online-business/">FIRE early</a> before graduating thanks to crypto so I didnt pursue the industry</p>
      <p>so >2018, i went around <a href="https://johnamata.com/photos/skiface.jpg">travelling</a>, mostly in the Philippines but also around East Asia, South America, Middle East, and Europe</p>
      <p>i make money from twitter bots and e-commerce, i'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">crypto fan</a> since 2014 though so 99% of my profits goes to more crypto</p>
      <p>lately my passion in code reignited, particularly after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzFUMGbVxlQs5s-LNAyKgcq5SL28ZLLKC">geohot's programming livestream</a> during the COVID-19 lockdowns</p>
      <p>so around 2021, i decided to relearn my fundamentals, build a portfolio, and go back to the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7mozi7oNRQQ?t=139">cue the music</a>.  let's go!</p>
